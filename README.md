<h2 align="center">First project in full-stack development</h2>

### Application Description:
S2B (Seller to Buyer) Application is a dynamic web platform tailored for efficient interactions between sellers and buyers. With intuitive role-based user registration, sellers can easily showcase their products, while buyers benefit from direct communication channels for inquiries. The platform facilitates seamless account editing for users and grants administrators robust privileges for platform management, including user account deletion.

<b>Role-based user registration:</b> This feature allows different types of users (such as buyers, sellers, and administrators) to register for the web application. Each user registers with specific details based on their role, providing necessary information for the platform to distinguish between buyers, sellers, and admins.

Product listing: Sellers are enabled to list their products on the platform. They provide details such as product name, description, price, and images. This functionality allows sellers to showcase their products to potential buyers on the platform.

Account editing: Both buyers and sellers have the capability to edit their account details. This feature enables users to update their personal information, such as contact details, shipping address, or profile picture, ensuring that their account information remains up-to-date.

Messaging feature: A messaging feature is implemented to facilitate direct communication between buyers and sellers. Buyers can inquire about products, negotiate prices, or ask questions directly to the sellers through this messaging feature, streamlining the communication process between both parties.

Admin privileges: Administrators have elevated privileges compared to regular users. They have access to user management functionalities, allowing them to oversee and manage user accounts. This includes the capability to delete user accounts if necessary, ensuring proper management and maintenance of the platform. Admins may also have access to other administrative tasks such as analytics, content moderation, or system configuration.
